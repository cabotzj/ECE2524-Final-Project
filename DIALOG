### NOTE: This dialog was written for a previous game idea. Please ignore. ###


OPENING:
"I'm not quite sure how I ended up here. I'm not even sure where 'here' is. I suppose that's kind of irrelevant though; for some reason, I'm hardly surprised this is where I ended up. The 'where' and the 'how' have shriveled and faded, and now all that remains is the 'why'. I'm terribly afraid of losing the 'why'. If the 'why' leaves, all that's left is the 'is', and just existing for the sake of existing is an awfully frightening prospect."

DUNGEON CRAWL:
"In this place, in this Here, anything I imagine, I can make reality. That is, if reality even exists anymore. Sometimes, I imagine I'm a daring explorer, boldly forging into the unknown, fighting off beasties and vermin with the thought of treasure alight in my mind."

SIDESCROLLER:
"I like to think that if I keep on running, I may finally go Somewhere. The freedom of running, the feeling of escape and the illusion of direction masks, if only briefly, the cold fact that Somewhere doesn't exist, and that I'll only ever be Here, and not even Nowhere. Still, I may as well try..."

COOKING:
"In this 'here', I am a prestigious chef, the likes of which even the French Masters cannot compare. I can sautee, bake, broil, roast, and braise effortlessly. Recipes and dishes form in my mind as I toil, immersed in a craft which developed from the most humble and basic of human necessities: the need for food."

TREASURE HUNT:
"I am like the raven; I wish to collect and hoard. I wish to accumulate. It really is amusing - how meaningless this desire for physical wealth. My compulsive need to work to accumulate some measly collection of things when I lived Back Then seems so trite, now that I have spent time Here. Still, I suppose it couldn't hurt to appease this old habit..."

DREAMS/REFlECTIONS:
[Sleep - time for character development]

THE END:
Minigames incomplete:
	"I feel drawn to this path, but when I come to its start, I feel as though I still have business yet unfinished here..."

Minigames complete:
	"Surely, this must lead to the precipice of Here. I feel as if I should harbor misgivings about proceeding. Could I ever return? Would I want to return? Will I change? I suppose these questions have no inherent worth; what I am Now is different from what I will be Then, and perhaps Then is where I ought to be."

Closing Dialog:
[Meet the Other]
